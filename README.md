# CircleNet-AI

## User-uploaded media storage

Profile photos, gallery files, and conversation attachments are never written into the application JAR/WAR and are not stored as database blobs. The backend uses a shared media platform; PostgreSQL stores object metadata and application references.

- `CIRCLENET_UPLOAD_DIR` sets the external/persistent upload directory. The local default is `./var/circlenet/uploads` relative to the backend process.
- `CIRCLENET_MEDIA_BASE_URL` sets the externally reachable backend origin used in stored media URLs. The local default is `http://localhost:8080`.
- In Docker/Kubernetes local-storage deployments, mount `CIRCLENET_UPLOAD_DIR` as a persistent volume.
- Set `CIRCLENET_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`, `CIRCLENET_S3_BUCKET`, and `CIRCLENET_S3_REGION` to use private AWS S3 or an S3-compatible cloud. `CIRCLENET_S3_ENDPOINT` supports services such as MinIO.
- AWS credentials use the standard SDK credential chain (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, workload identity, instance role, or container role).
- Objects are encrypted with S3 AES-256, signed download URLs are supported, and uploads receive checksum, file-signature, scanner, thumbnail, quota, retention, and deletion handling.
- `CIRCLENET_MEDIA_USER_QUOTA_BYTES` changes the default 1 GiB per-user quota.

CircleNet-AI is an enterprise-grade platform architecture for AI-native collaboration, identity, and knowledge workflows. This repository establishes the initial foundation for the platform and is structured to support future frontend, backend, infrastructure, and AI modules.

## Delivery status

As of 8 August 2026, all 10 originally documented milestones are implemented and verified. Six production milestones remain in the forward roadmap. See [Milestone Status](docs/milestone-status.md) for verification evidence, scope boundaries, and the pending work.

## Milestone 1: Foundation Repository

This milestone delivers the core repository scaffolding for a production-ready engineering workflow:

- Repository metadata and licensing
- Standardized editor and Git configuration
- Container-based local development environment
- CI workflow that validates repository structure and runs backend, frontend, AI, and mobile checks
- Initial module directories for future implementation

## Milestone 2: Relationship Domain Foundation

This milestone delivers the secured backend domain APIs for the collaboration graph:

- User and person management
- Circles and relationship management
- Permission management
- Authenticated CRUD endpoints with missing-resource handling
- Integration coverage for each relationship-domain API lifecycle

## Milestone 3: Project Delivery Foundation

This milestone provides the delivery-planning backend capabilities:

- Projects, milestones, and tasks
- Milestone status updates, blocking reasons, and bulk status changes
- Task filtering by milestone and milestone filtering by project
- Authenticated dashboard summary data
- Flyway migrations, data-quality constraints, and development seed data

## Milestone 4: Web Design System Foundation

This milestone establishes the shared web presentation baseline:

- Design tokens for color, typography, spacing, radii, and elevation
- Reusable layout, component, and utility styles
- Responsive design-system demonstration page
- A documented foundation for the Next.js application

- `make docker-up` - Start local infrastructure services
- `make docker-down` - Stop local infrastructure services
- `make ci` - Run repository validation steps
- `make ai-install` - Install AI service dependencies
- `make ai-run` - Run AI service locally
- `make ai-test` - Run AI service test suite
- `make mobile-get` - Install Flutter mobile dependencies
- `make mobile-test` - Run Flutter mobile tests

## Milestone 5: AI Module Foundation

Milestone 5 starts with an initial AI service module under `ai/agent-service`.

Current capabilities:

- FastAPI service scaffold with health endpoints
- Versioned API namespace (`/api/v1`)
- Strongly typed request/response models
- Config-driven behavior via environment variables
- Test baseline for service health checks

## Milestone 6: Mobile Foundation

Milestone 6 starts with an initial Flutter module under `mobile/flutter-app`.

Current capabilities:

- Android, iOS, and browser-preview Flutter targets
- Material 3 design system with adaptive phone/tablet navigation
- Sign In, Sign Up, JWT refresh, persisted sessions, logout, and revocation
- Relationship discovery, privacy/verification tags, and relationship creation
- Circle creation and private/group conversation experiences
- Profile, address, communication, education, and employment fields
- Authenticated image, audio, video, PDF, and document attachment display
- Native camera, microphone, and media permission declarations
- Widget tests and clean Flutter static analysis

## Milestone 7: Web Authenticated Dashboard

Milestone 7 secures the Next.js dashboard with backend JWT session flows.

Current capabilities:

- Web sign-in page integrated with `POST /api/auth/login`
- Browser session persistence for access and refresh tokens
- Automatic token refresh fallback via `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- Authenticated dashboard API calls using bearer access tokens
- Web logout flow integrated with `POST /api/auth/logout`

## Milestone 8: Web Session Bootstrap Experience

Milestone 8 improves public-to-authenticated flow on the Next.js web app.

Current capabilities:

- Landing page always remains available without login
- Public auth service health check integration via `GET /api/auth/health`
- Session-aware landing behavior that enriches workspace data for signed-in users
- Sign-out action available directly from the landing navigation
- Consistent authenticated handoff to dashboard workflows

## Milestone 9: Session Identity Introspection

Milestone 9 adds authenticated user identity introspection for web clients.

Current capabilities:

- Backend `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint for access-token session profile retrieval
- Bearer-protected auth-me path via JWT security filter and security chain rules
- Frontend session profile client integration for landing and dashboard experiences
- Signed-in identity context displayed in web navigation surfaces

## Milestone 10: Web Session Control Center

Milestone 10 adds first-class web session lifecycle controls and observability.

Current capabilities:

- Dedicated session control page at `/session`
- Live session identity and token lifetime visibility for signed-in users
- Manual access token refresh workflow using `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- Explicit session revocation workflow using `POST /api/auth/revoke`
- Unified navigation entry points to session controls from landing and dashboard pages

## Quality Standards

This repository is intended to support the following standards from the start:

- Consistent formatting
- Repeatable local development
- Container-based dependency management
- CI validation
- Clear documentation and scaffolding
