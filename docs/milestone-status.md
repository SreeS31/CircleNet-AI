# CircleNet-AI Milestone Status

Audit date: 9 August 2026

## Summary

| Category | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Total engineering milestones | 17 |
| Implemented milestones | 17 |
| Pending engineering milestones | 0 |
| External production activation items | 4 groups |

All planned application milestones are implemented. Production activation still requires the owner's cloud/provider accounts, secrets, signing identities, DNS, and independent operational validation; those items cannot be safely embedded in source code.

## Implemented milestones

| Milestone | Status | Verification evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Foundation Repository | Complete | Repository structure, Compose, Make targets, and multi-module CI are present. |
| 2. Relationship Domain Foundation | Complete | Secured person, circle, relationship, permission APIs, migrations, and integration tests are present. |
| 3. Project Delivery Foundation | Complete | Project, milestone, task, filters, bulk status, constraints, and dashboard flows are implemented. |
| 4. Web Design System Foundation | Complete | Shared tokens, responsive layouts, controls, buttons, tags, and design samples are present. |
| 5. AI Module Foundation | Complete | FastAPI service, versioned health API, configuration, typed models, and tests are present. |
| 6. Mobile Foundation | Complete | Flutter Android, iOS, and web targets with adaptive authentication and core feature UI are present. |
| 7. Web Authenticated Dashboard | Complete | JWT-authenticated dashboard and session-aware API client are implemented. |
| 8. Web Session Bootstrap Experience | Complete | Public landing, auth health, session handoff, and sign-out are implemented. |
| 9. Session Identity Introspection | Complete | `/api/auth/me` and authenticated identity display are implemented. |
| 10. Web Session Control Center | Complete | Session identity, refresh, logout, and revoke controls are implemented. |
| 11. Native Mobile Feature Parity | Complete | Attachments, family tree, circles, messaging, settings, WebRTC calls, offline cache, refresh, and background sync are implemented. |
| 12. Notifications and Invitation Delivery | Complete | Persistent inbox, preferences, outbox/history, retry dispatcher, unsubscribe tokens, device registration, and configurable delivery webhook are implemented. |
| 13. Cloud Media Platform | Complete | Local/private-S3 providers, signed downloads, encryption, metadata, checksum/signature validation, scanning interface, quota, cleanup, deletion, and thumbnails are implemented. |
| 14. Production Deployment and App Release | Complete | Non-root production images, Caddy TLS stack, Kubernetes manifests/HPA/probes/resources, secret injection, and tagged web/mobile release workflow are implemented. |
| 15. Security, Reliability, and End-to-End Quality | Complete | Rate limiting, mutation audit, abuse moderation, Prometheus health/metrics, Trivy CI, backup/restore runbook, and Playwright desktop/mobile accessibility checks are implemented. |
| 16. AI-Native Product Capabilities | Complete | Explainable search ranking, duplicate suggestions, consent-gated family insights/profile enrichment, human-review flags, limits, proxy API, and evaluations are implemented. |
| 17. AI Contact Organizer | Complete | Optional post-login contact permission, native Android/iOS reader, multilingual relationship classification, dynamic company/education/family circle suggestions, confidence/reasons, review/edit/remove controls, and explicit confirmation are implemented. Raw contacts are not retained by the analysis service. |

## Verification results

- Backend: 24 tests passed; 26 Flyway migrations validated.
- Frontend: production build and eight-page static generation passed; dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities. Two advisory `<img>` optimization warnings remain for authenticated blob images.
- Browser quality: four Playwright checks passed across desktop and mobile Chromium, including critical WCAG 2.0/2.1 A/AA checks.
- AI service: six tests passed.
- Mobile: widget tests passed and `flutter analyze` reports no issues.
- Infrastructure: production Docker Compose interpolation and schema validation passed using placeholder deployment values.

## External production activation checklist

1. Provision SMS/email/push provider accounts and Firebase/APNs credentials, then validate notifications on physical devices.
2. Provision the production object bucket/CDN and managed malware scanner, then validate lifecycle and restore behavior in the selected cloud account.
3. Supply domain/DNS, TLS destination, database/Redis credentials, container registry, Android keystore, Apple certificates, and store accounts; run staging promotion before production.
4. Run an independent penetration test, privacy/legal review, backup restore drill, alert-routing exercise, and signed Android/iOS store submission.

These are deployment-owner actions involving external authority or credentials, not missing application code.
